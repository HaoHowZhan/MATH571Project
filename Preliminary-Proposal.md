## Introduction

Recommendation systems are active area of research in artificial intelligence. The algorithms of recommendation systems are based on machine learning. Data mining algorithms extract knowledge from unstructured data, for example collaborative filtering, content filtering, association rules, and clustering. Movie recommendation is one of the specific application of that.

## State of Problem & Plan

Recommendation is widely used by many kinds of websites such as Amazon, Facebook etc. We group members are more interested in movies, thus we would like to make efforts on how to build a model by using data sets from users. 

* One of our possible model is movie recommendation model based on users’ previous rates,tags or other metrics of movies they have watched. 
* Another possible model is the one which describes how to create a new movie that would be highly likely successful after training data set of movies from top to bottom of ranking according to their actors, director,themes,plots and etc, we want to find potential relationship between  movie ratings and movies’ possible attributes. Actually,  we tend to use some machine learning algorithms and decision trees into our model. Crawler skill may also be necessary in some cases. 

## Data Set

Our preliminary data set may be from the website with this link: <http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/20m/>.

Additional information may be necessary, thus we may use crawler skill to collect other data sets from other website such as IMDB. <http://www.imdb.com/>

## Project Objectives

* Know well about the whole process of data mining,modeling and data analysis.
* Successfully build the movie recommendation model with satisfying outcomes.
* To know how to manage the data analysis project & control the process within schedule.

## KPI we’ll use

## Final Deliverables

Our project’s final deliverables will be showed like following format:

* Report of project process, including what algorithms we used, how to finish each step such as data collecting & data cleaning & adjustment of model & final test of model.
* A small website  to demo how our model performs by receiving data input from users and return the outcome.
